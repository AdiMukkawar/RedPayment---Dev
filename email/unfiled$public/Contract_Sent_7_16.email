Hi {!Opportunity.Owner_1_First_Name__c},

I wanted to reach out because I still haven’t seen your funding agreement come in. Please call me so I can answer any questions you may have. As soon as we receive the agreement and final documents I will submit them to our funding department to get a wire to you right away! You can simply email or fax me the signed agreement and remaining documents necessary to fund your account. Let’s build a great long-term relationship!

Best Wishes,
{!Opportunity.OwnerFirstName} {!Opportunity.OwnerLastName}
